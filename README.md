Introduction
The world of art is vast and diverse, with each artist possessing a unique style that sets them apart. This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to determine which artist's style a given painting resembles the most. By training a model on a carefully curated dataset of paintings from various artists, we can create a tool that provides insights into the artistic influences behind a piece of artwork.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x / PyTorch 1.x (Choose one as per your preference)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
Required libraries as mentioned in requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/artistic-similarity-model.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd artistic-similarity-model
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: The dataset used for training the model needs to be prepared. Refer to the Data section for details on the dataset and its structure.

Model Training: The model architecture and training process are outlined in the Training section. You can adjust hyperparameters and experiment with different architectures.

Evaluation: After training, the model's performance needs to be evaluated. Details on evaluation metrics and procedures can be found in the Evaluation section.

Inference: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to determine the artist's similarity for a given painting. This can be done by loading the trained model and using it for predictions.

Data
The dataset used for this project comprises a collection of paintings from various artists. Each painting is labeled with the corresponding artist's name. Unfortunately, due to licensing restrictions, we cannot provide the dataset in this repository. However, instructions for obtaining a similar dataset from open sources are provided in the data_sources.md file.

Model
The chosen model architecture for this project is a [brief description of your model architecture].

Training
To train the model, follow these steps:

Preprocess the data, including data augmentation if necessary.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Define the model architecture using the provided code.
Train the model using the training set and validate using the validation set.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
Refer to the training.ipynb notebook for a detailed example of the training process.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, or custom metrics suited for the task. The evaluation process involves making predictions on the test set and comparing them with the ground truth labels. More details can be found in the evaluation.ipynb notebook.

Results
The model achieved [mention the results achieved by your model, such as accuracy, precision, etc.]. For more details on the results, refer to the results.md file.
